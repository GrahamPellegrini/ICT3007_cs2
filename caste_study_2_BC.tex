\section{Part C: Reflection}
\subsection{1.What did Julie decide to do about the leak of confidential information in Sam’s team? Discuss what she should have done? Why?}

What was done:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Julie decided to confront Sam directly about the leak of confidential information in his team.
    \item She decided not to escalate the issue to the board
    \item To avoid damaging Sams reputation and her own.
\end{itemize}
\\
What should have been done and why:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Julie should have spoken to Sam in private about the leak of confidential information.
    \item She should have conviced and advised him to discuss this issue with Steve and John possibly at a board meeting.
    \item Since the leadership dynamic is small and still a family dynamic there shouldn't be reason to not discuss this issue with the board. 
    \item No ones reputation should be damaged if the issue is discussed in a professional mannerr.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2. What did Sam decide to do about the software bug in Julie’s product? Discuss what he should have done? Why?}

What was done:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sam decided to confront Julie directly in a sincere manner.
    \item He should explaine the situation and the consequences of the software bug.
    \item This would allow Julie to fix the issue before the launch.
    \item After the bug is fixed, in the next board meeting, Sam should discuss the issue with the board.
    \item Applauding Julie for her work and the quick fix of the bug.
    \item Also shining light on his ability to see the bigger picture and help the business even outside of his departemental responsibilities
\end{itemize}

What should have been done and why: Agreed with the actions taken by Sam.

\subsection{3. What did Steve decide to do about the conflict? Discuss what he should have done? Why?}

\subsection{4. What did John decide to do about monitoring Sam and Julie? Discuss what he should have done? Why?}

What did John do:

    \item
