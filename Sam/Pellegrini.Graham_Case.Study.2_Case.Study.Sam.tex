\subsection{f.What leadership style should Sam employ?}

\subsection{f. What leadership style should Sam employ?}
Sam should employ a \textbf{democratic leadership style} this will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Involve the team in decision-making while retaining final responsibility. When engaged in the decision-making process, employees are more likely to be motivated and committed to the success of the business.
    \item Foster an enviroment for inspiring ideas. The openess of the democratic leadership style will allow for the team to share their ideas and contribute to the growth of the business.
    \item Delegate tasks between team members, ensuring Sam is not overwhelmed with the day-to-day operations and can focus on the management of the business.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{g. How should he liaise with Julie and the Computer Engineering Division?}
- The two departements are seperate in their operations. \\
- So colobaration is more trivial than functional. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross departmental meetings} - Sam and Julie can understand each other's operations and the reason behind decisions taken.
    \item \textbf{Delegated meetings} - Meetings can be delegated to department heads that would then report back to Sam and Julie. This would also alow word to flow between the two departments.
    \item \textbf{celebrate achievements} - Building on the flow of word between the two departments, Sam and Julie can celebrate departmental achievements. For example by hanging a poster in the break room or sending out a company wide email. This would create a sense of unity and teamwork between the two departments.
    \item \textbf{Departemental Dissagreeements} - If disagreements arise between the two departments the only level it should be escalated to is at the board level and should not trickle down to the team level.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{h. What are your first requests going to be to the board?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Capital Investment} I would like to request a capital investment in training or resources where the team will benefit also on a personal level. This would drive enthusiasm to the team and allow them to feel more valued. \\
    \item \textbf{Online Store} I would like to explore the possibility of an online store. This would allow us to reach a wider audience and possibly bring in more revenue. However, keeping in mind the challenges and risks that have kept us from doing so in the past. \\
    \item \textbf{Personal Development} I am open to the fact that I will make mistakes. So I wish to be to properly learn from them with guidance rather than solutions from Steve. \\
\end{itemize}
